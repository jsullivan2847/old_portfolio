My software engineering journey begins a few years ago while
studying sound design for game audio. When I realized I really enjoyed
the programming side of the process I started teaching myself C# using
the Unity game engine. I loved the way programming requires a balance 
of creative skills and problem solving. Soon after I enrolled in an 
immersive bootcamp with General Assembly where I learned how to apply my skills 
in a professional setting, working with new technologies and collaborating
with team-members. I'm excited to continue this journey and bring my growing 
skill-set to a new team.
